# Lewis Clifford Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work and projects as a developer. The site highlights various projects I've worked on and provides direct links to view their code on GitHub.
Some of the projects are not public as of yet so the links are not functional as of yet.

You can view the live site here: [lewisclifford63.github.io/Portfolio_project](https://lewisclifford63.github.io/Portfolio_project/)
